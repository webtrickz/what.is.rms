Statistically, the root mean square (RMS) is the square root of the mean square, which is the arithmetic mean of the squares of a group of values. RMS is also called a quadratic mean and is a special case of the generalized mean whose exponent is 2. Root mean square is also defined as a varying function based on an integral of the squares of the values which are instantaneous in a cycle.

## What is the root mean square?

The root mean square (RMS or rms) is defined as the square root of the mean square, i.e. the arithmetic mean of the squares of a given set of numbers.

In other words, the RMS of a group of numbers is the square of the arithmetic mean or the functionâ€™s square which defines the continuous waveform.

## How to Calculate the Root Mean Square

_Steps to Find the Root mean square for a given set of values are given below:_

Step 1: Get the squares of all the values
Step 2: Calculate the average of the obtained squares
Step 3: Finally, take the square root of the average

## Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

The Root Mean Square Error or RMSE is a frequently applied measure of the differences between numbers (population values and samples) which is predicted by an estimator or a mode. The RMSE describes the sample standard deviation of the differences between the predicted and observed values. Each of these differences is known as residuals when the calculations are done over the data sample that was used to estimate, and known as prediction errors when calculated out of sample. The RMSE aggregates the magnitudes of the errors in predicting different times into a single measure of predictive power.
